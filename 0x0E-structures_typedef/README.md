## Introduction

C is a powerful programming language that allows you to create custom data structures and enhance code readability with `typedef`. This project provides examples and explanations for using structures and typedef in your C programs.

## Structures

In C, structures allow you to define custom data types that can group together variables of different data types under a single name. Structured data types are useful for representing real-world entities or concepts in your code. This project demonstrates how to define, initialize, and use structures effectively.

## Typedef

The `typedef` keyword is used to create aliases or alternate names for existing data types, including structures. It improves code readability by allowing you to define custom names for data types, making your code more self-explanatory. This project shows how to use `typedef` to simplify code and make it more understandable.

## How to Use

To explore the examples in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Review the code examples in the source files.
4. Compile and run the examples to see them in action.

## Compilation

Ensure that you have a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system. You can compile the code examples using the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 example.c -o example
