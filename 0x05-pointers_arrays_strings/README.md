## Pointers

### What are Pointers?

In C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. They are used for direct memory manipulation and dynamic memory allocation.

### How to Use Pointers

- Declaring Pointers: Use the `datatype *ptr` syntax to declare a pointer to a specific data type.
- Assigning Addresses: You can assign the address of a variable to a pointer using the `&` operator.
- Accessing Values: To access the value pointed to by a pointer, use the `*` operator.

### Examples

```c
int num = 42;
int *ptr = &num; // Declare and assign a pointer

// Access the value using a pointer
int value = *ptr; // value will be 42

// Modify the value using a pointer
*ptr = 99; // num is now 99

Arrays
What are Arrays?
Arrays are collections of variables of the same data type. They allow you to store multiple values under a single name and are indexed from 0.

How to Use Arrays
Declaring Arrays: Use the datatype arrayName[size] syntax to declare an array.
Accessing Elements: Elements in an array are accessed using their index (e.g., arrayName[index]).
Iterating through Arrays: Loops are commonly used to process array elements.
Examples

int myArray[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

// Accessing elements
int element = myArray[2]; // element is 30

// Iterating through array
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", myArray[i]);
}


Strings
What are Strings?
In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. They are null-terminated, meaning they end with a null character ('\0').

How to Use Strings
Declaring Strings: Use the char stringName[] = "text"; syntax to declare a string.
String Functions: You can use library functions like strlen, strcpy, and strcat for string manipulation.
Examples

char myString[] = "Hello, World!";

// Accessing characters
char firstChar = myString[0]; // firstChar is 'H'

// Using strlen to get string length
int length = strlen(myString);
