# C File I/O

This repository contains C code examples and explanations related to File Input/Output (I/O) operations in the C programming language. File I/O is an essential aspect of programming, allowing you to read and write data to and from files. Understanding how to work with files is crucial for tasks such as reading configuration files, processing data, and more.

## Contents

1. **Introduction to File I/O**: Learn the basics of file I/O, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

2. **File Descriptors**: Understand what file descriptors are and how they are used to identify open files in a process.

3. **Standard File Descriptors**: Explore the three standard file descriptors (`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`) and their significance.

4. **File Permissions**: Learn how to set file permissions when creating files and understand the concepts of read, write, and execute permissions.

5. **System Calls**: Understand what system calls are and how they are used to interact with the operating system for file I/O operations.

6. **File I/O Best Practices**: Discover best practices for error handling, memory management, and portability when working with files.
