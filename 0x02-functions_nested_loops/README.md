## Introduction

This project aims to help you practice and understand the fundamentals of functions and nested loops in C programming. By completing the tasks outlined in this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in writing functions to perform specific tasks and utilizing nested loops to solve complex problems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `0-putchar.c`: A C program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line, using the provided `_putchar` function.
- `main.h`: A header file containing function prototypes used throughout the project.
- `README.md`: This document, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Files should end with a new line.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style guidelines.
- No global variables allowed.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Do not use standard library functions (e.g., printf, puts).
- `_putchar` function is provided.
- Prototypes for all functions and `_putchar` should be included in `main.h`.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-low_level_programming.git
