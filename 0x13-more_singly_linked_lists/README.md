## Introduction

A singly linked list is a data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically has a NULL reference, indicating the end of the list. Singly linked lists are useful for dynamic storage of data and can be easily traversed from the beginning to the end.

This program provides a set of functions for creating, manipulating, and working with singly linked lists.
