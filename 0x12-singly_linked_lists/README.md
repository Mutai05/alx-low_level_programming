# Singly Linked Lists

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science that allows you to organize and manage a collection of elements in a linear fashion. Each element, known as a "node," contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The last node typically points to `NULL`, indicating the end of the list.

This repository contains C code examples and explanations related to singly linked lists. It demonstrates how to create, manipulate, and work with singly linked lists using the C programming language.

## Introduction to Singly Linked Lists

### Why Use Singly Linked Lists?

Singly linked lists offer advantages such as efficient insertions and deletions, dynamic sizing, and the ability to represent various data structures like stacks and queues. Understanding and mastering singly linked lists is essential for building more complex data structures and algorithms.

### Key Concepts

- **Node**: The basic building block of a singly linked list, containing data and a pointer to the next node.
- **Head**: The first node in the list.
- **Tail**: The last node in the list, pointing to `NULL`.
- **Traversal**: Iterating through the list from the head to the tail.
- **Insertion**: Adding new nodes to the list.
- **Deletion**: Removing nodes from the list.
- **Searching**: Finding specific nodes based on their data.
