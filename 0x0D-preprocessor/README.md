# Preprocessors in C

This repository provides an overview of preprocessor directives and their usage in the C programming language.

## Introduction

In C programming, the preprocessor is a vital component that performs text manipulations on your source code before the actual compilation process. Preprocessor directives start with a `#` symbol and are processed before the code is compiled. They are often used for tasks like including header files, defining macros, and conditional compilation.

## Contents

This repository includes examples and explanations of common preprocessor directives and their usage:

- `#include`: How to include header files.
- `#define`: Defining macros for code substitution.
- `#ifdef` and `#ifndef`: Conditional compilation based on macro existence.
- `#if`, `#elif`, and `#else`: Conditional compilation based on expressions.
- `#undef`: Undefining macros.
- `##` operator: Concatenating macro values.
- `#pragma`: Compiler-specific directives.

## How to Use

You can explore the examples provided in this repository to learn about each preprocessor directive and how to use them effectively in your C code.

## Prerequisites

To run the code examples, you need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing C code.

## Getting Started
