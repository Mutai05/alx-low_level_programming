## Description

Debugging is an essential skill for any programmer. This repository aims to provide hands-on experience in debugging C programs, covering various types of errors such as syntax errors, logical errors, and runtime errors. Each example program includes detailed comments and explanations to guide learners through the debugging process step by step.

## Contents

The repository is organized into separate directories, each containing a specific debugging example. Each directory typically includes:

- A C source code file with the original buggy code.
- A corrected version of the code with comments explaining the changes.
- A `README.md` file within each directory providing a detailed breakdown of the debugging challenge, the expected outcome, and the solution.

## Usage

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific example directory you're interested in.
3. Read the `README.md` file for an overview of the debugging challenge and its expected outcome.
4. Study the original buggy code to understand the issue.
5. Review the corrected code and the accompanying explanations.
6. Compile and run the corrected code to see the expected outcome.

Feel free to explore and learn from the examples provided. Each example offers insights into different debugging scenarios and techniques.
