# Recursion in C Programming

This project explores the concept of recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This README provides an overview and examples of how to use recursion effectively in C.

## Introduction to Recursion

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's a technique widely used in algorithms and data structures. Key components of recursion include:

- **Base Case:** A condition that determines when the recursion should stop.
- **Recursive Case:** The part of the function that calls itself with a smaller or simpler instance of the problem.

## How to Implement Recursion

To implement recursion in C, follow these steps:

1. Define a function that calls itself.
2. Include a base case that specifies when the recursion should stop.
3. In the recursive case, call the function with a smaller or simpler problem.

Here's a simple example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // Base case
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
    }
}
