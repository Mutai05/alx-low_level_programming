## Introduction

In this project, we explore the fundamental concepts of functions and nested loops in C programming. Functions are essential for code organization and reusability, while nested loops are useful for handling repetitive tasks involving multiple levels of iteration.

## Functions

The `_isupper` function is implemented to check if a given character is an uppercase letter. It returns 1 if the character is uppercase and 0 otherwise. This demonstrates function prototypes, definition, and usage.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are illustrated through various code snippets. These loops involve multiple levels of iteration and are useful for working with two-dimensional data structures or performing complex repetitive tasks.

## Usage

Each code snippet in this repository provides examples of how to use specific functions or implement nested loops. The provided `main.c` files demonstrate how to test the functions and observe their behavior.

## Compilation

To compile the code examples in this repository, you can use the provided `gcc` command with the required compilation flags. For instance:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c function_example.c -o function_example
